<!-- An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>  -->

<!-- HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break). -->
<!-- Elements can be nested (elements containing elements) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>. -->

		<h1> My First Heading </h1> <!-- The <h1> element defines a heading. It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>. The element content is: My First Heading. -->

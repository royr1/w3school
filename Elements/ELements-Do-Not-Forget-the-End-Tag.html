<!-- DO NOT FORGET THE END TAG
Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p> This is a paragraph.
		<p> This is a paragraph.
	</body>
</html>

<!-- The example above works in all browsers, because the closing tag is considered optional.

NENVER RELY ON THIS. MIGHT PRODUCE UNEXPECTED RESULTS &/OR ERRORS IF YOU FORGET THE END TAG -->		

<!-- HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.

<br> is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br> tag defines a line break).

Empty elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: <br />. -->
